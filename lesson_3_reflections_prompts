When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you're working with others or might need to work from multiple computers. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because you may want to approve what someone else has worked on before pulling.
