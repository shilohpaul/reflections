When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you're working with others or might need to work from multiple computers. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because you may want to approve what someone else has worked on before pulling. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks: Always used with GitHub to make an exact copy of one account onto another account
Clones: Used locally or between GitHub and Local. Used if you want to make an exact copy of GitHub repository on local. Can also be used to clone a local repository to local. Forking and cloning are good if you want to use someone else's code as a building block to create something of your own. 
Branches: Used within one repository. Allows multiple people to work on a single repository. Later the branches can be combined into master if all changes are wanted. Generally working towards one goal rather than creating something different based off of an original.
